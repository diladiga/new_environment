# We can use "avail_wheels library" to see if the library is available in the wheels


The pip command can install packages from a variety of sources, including PyPI and pre-built distribution packages called Python wheels. 
Compute canada provides Python wheels for a number of packages. 

the --no-index option tells pip to not install from PyPI, but instead to install only from locally-available packages, i.e. our wheels.

Compared to using packages from PyPI, wheels that have been compiled by our staff can prevent issues with missing or conflicting dependencies, 
and were optimised for our clusters hardware and libraries.
