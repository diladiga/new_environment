In Compute Canada, you should use your Project directory, which will be placed under your supervisorâ€™s directory and look something like: 
~/projects/def-supervisor/your-username

This is a good location to store your git repositories, job scripts, and any binary files associated with your project. 
Because the Project filepath is not necessarily easy to remember, you can define an alias or environment variable as a shortcut to get to it more quickly. 
To do this, add the following line at the end of the .bashrc file or in .bash_aliases file:

export project=~/projects/def-supervisor/your-username

Now whenever you use the variable $project when logged into CC, it will refer to your project directory. 
So for example cd $project will take you to your project directory.
